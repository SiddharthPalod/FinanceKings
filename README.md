## News
The core page which fetches news from Newsapi and uses the values of offset,n, and topic inputted by the user gives a list of articles with responsive boxes
If we click these boxes then we are redirected to the main article page in a new tab. We have focussed on keeping a sleek design 
while maintaining the functionality of the website
